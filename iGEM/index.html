                        <p> Hong Kong has had a thriving oyster industry for 700 years. The presence of oysters in Hong Kong’s bays and oceans has helped the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen and grown the seafood industry that is so ingrained in Hong Kong’s vibrant aquaculture. However, one aspect of this key industry has not been addressed. Oyster contamination. </p>
                        <p> Oysters are often contaminated with bacteria vibrio spp., a common gram-negative bacteria often found in marine environments. Contamination takes place as oysters feed. When filtering water, this bacteria can often become concentrated in oyster tissue, making it dangerous for consumption, especially raw.</p>

                        <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
